# BigPEye

Memory viewer for BigPEmu Jaguar emulator. It's very preliminary code. I might extend it with more features. Or not. I don't know yet.

## Installation

Copy `BigPEye.c` and `BigPEye.dll` to BigPEmu Scripts directory and enable script module.

## Usage

Use mouse to move around. Mouse scroller to zoom. Zooming with shift pressed uses only integer zoom steps.
